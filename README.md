# Big Data Basics
This project is my starting point for learning Big Data technologies. The goal is to build a strong foundation in the concepts, tools, and ecosystems that power large-scale data processing.


## What I’m Learning
Big Data Concepts – Understanding what Big Data is, its characteristics (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, Value).

Hadoop Ecosystem – Basics of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), MapReduce, and YARN.

Data Processing Tools – Introduction to Apache Spark, Hive, Pig, and other frameworks.

Data Storage & Databases – Working with structured and unstructured data in distributed systems.
## Objective
To gain hands-on knowledge of how large datasets are stored, processed, and analyzed using modern Big Data tools, and gradually move toward advanced topics like real-time data streaming and cloud-based data solutions.
